# = GraphMediator
#
# GraphMediator is used to coordinate changes between a graph of ActiveRecord
# objects related to a root node.  See README.rdoc for details.
#
# GraphMediator::Base::DSL - is the simple class macro language used to set up
# mediation.
#
# == Versioning and Optimistic Locking
#
# If you include an integer +lock_version+ column in your class, it will be
# incremented only once within a mediated_transaction and will serve as the
# optimistic locking check for the entire graph so long as you have declared
# all your dependent models for mediation.
#
# Outside of a mediated_transaction, +lock_version+ will increment per update
# as usual.
#
# == Convenience Methods for Save Without Mediation
#
# There are convenience method to perform a save, save!, toggle,
# toggle!, update_attribute, update_attributes or update_attributes!
# call without mediation.  They are of the form <method>_without_mediation<punc>
# 
# For example, save_without_mediation! is equivalent to:
#
#  instance.disable_mediation!
#  instance.save!
#  instance.enable_mediation!
#
# == Overriding
# 
# GraphMediator overrides ActiveRecord's save_without_transaction to slip in
# mediation just before the save process is wrapped in a transaction.
# 
# * save_without_transaction
# * save_without_transaction_with_mediation
# * save_without_transaction_without_mediation
# 
# may all be overridden in your implementation class, but they end up being
# defined locally by GraphMediator, so you can override with something like
# alias_method_chain, but will need to be in a subclass to use super.
# 
# My original intention was to define aliased overrides in MediatorProxy if the
# target was a method in a superclass (like save), so that the implementation
# class could make a simple def foo; something; super; end override, but this
# is prevented by a bug in ruby 1.8 with aliasing of methods that use super in
# a module.  http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/734

  # DSL for setting up and describing mediation.
  #
  # save and save! are automatically wrapped for mediation when GraphMediator
  # is included into your class.  You can mediate other methods with a call to
  # mediate(), and can setup callbacks for reconcilation, cacheing or version
  # bumping.
  #
  # = Callbacks
  #
  # The mediate() method takes options to set callbacks.  Or you can set them
  # directly with a method symbol, array of method symbols or a Proc.  They may
  # be called multiple times and may be added to in subclasses.
  #
  # * before_mediation - runs before mediation is begun
  # * - mediate and save
  # * mediate_reconciles - after saveing the instance, run any routines to make
  #   further adjustments to the structure of the graph or non-cache attributes
  # * mediate_caches - routines for updating cache values
  #
  # Example: 
  #
  #  mediate_reconciles :bar do |instance|
  #    instance.something_else
  #  end
  #  mediate_reconciles :baz
  #
  # will ensure that [:bar, <block>, :baz] are run in 
  # sequence after :foo is done saveing within the context of a mediated
  # transaction.
  #
  module DSL
    include AliasExtension

    # Establishes callbacks, dependencies and possible methods as entry points 
    # for mediation.
    #
    # * :methods => list of methods to mediate (automatically wrap in a
    #   mediated_transaction call)
    #
    # ActiveRecord::Base.save is decorated for mediation when GraphMediator
    # is included into your model.  If you have additional methods which 
    # perform bulk operations on members, you probably want to list them
    # here so that they are mediated as well.
    #
    # You should not list methods used for reconcilation, or cacheing.
    #
    # This macro takes a number of options:
    # 
    # * :options => hash of options
    #   * :dependencies => list of dependent member classes whose save methods
    #     should be decorated for mediation as well.
    #   * :when_reconciling => list of methods to execute during the
    #     after_mediation reconcilation phase
    #   * :when_cacheing => list of methods to execute during the
    #     after_mediation cacheing phase
    #
    #  mediate :update_children,
    #    :dependencies => Child,
    #    :when_reconciling => :reconcile,
    #    :when_caching => :cache 
    #
    # = Dependent Classes
    #
    # Dependent classes have their save methods mediated as well.  However, a
    # dependent class must provide an accessor for the root node, so that a
    # mediated_transaction can be begun in the root node when a dependent is
    # changed.  Dependent clases also have their destroy methods mediated so
    # that destruction of a dependent also registers as a change to the 
    # graph.
    # 
    # == Deletion and Dependents
    # 
    # When a class participating in mediation assigns a dependent to mediation,
    # destruction of that dependent class will cause an update to the parent's
    # lock_version.  This can cause a problem in Rails 2.3.6+ because
    # ActiveRecord#destroy is wrapped with an optimistic locking check.  When
    # the dependent association is set to :dependent => :destroy, the
    # dependents are automatically destroyed before the parent, which causes
    # graph_mediator to update the lock_version of the parent, which then fails
    # the optimistic locking check when it is sent for destruction in
    # ActiveRecord::Locking::Optimistic#destroy_with_lock.
    # 
    # To avoid this, GraphMediator causes an activerecord instance to flag when
    # it is in the process of destroying itself.  This flag is then checked by
    # dependents so they can bypass touching the parent when they are being
    # destroyed.
    #
    # = Versioning and Optimistic Locking
    #
    # GraphMediator uses the class's lock_column (default +lock_version+) and
    # +updated_at+ or +updated_on+ for versioning and locks checks during
    # mediation.  The lock_column is incremented only once during a
    # mediated_transaction.
    # 
    # <em>Unless both these columns are present in the schema,
    # versioning/locking will not happen.</em>  A lock_column by itself will
    # not be updated unless there is an updated_at/on timestamp available to
    # touch.
